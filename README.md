# Hi, we are Leeroy

## First off; some brief information

Following is a set of exercises that we would like you to complete and provide code examples. As there are plenty of different ways to approach each exercise it is important to understand that we are not looking for a specific answer; there is no right or wrong. The solution to each exercise will merely serve as the foundation for a discussion where we can learn about why you choose a specific logic or strategy. If you have any questions or something is unclear, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us prior to submitting your exercises.

Note that we expect you to fork the repository and create a separate branch (named according accordingly) for each of the exercises.

With that said; good luck!

## Exercise 1

Given the array (see line 3 in script.js) which consists of objects holding information regarding some amazing companies, we need your help to wrap the name and location of each company in a LI and attach it to the unordered list (#list) that we've already set up for you. Go!

## Exercise 2

Neat, that worked out well. Splendid! But... Being the curious cats we are, we would also like to know when someone clicks on a specific company in the list. Help!

## Exercise 3

We all know that requirements change over time - and the time for great change is now. Imagine that the array of companies has increased in size/length and suddenly contains some 100000 elements. Ouch, that's plenty! Given this rather drastic change, are there any specific optimization strategies (provided it is necessary) that you can employ to your implementation in exercise 2 to better fit the current condition?

## Exercise 4

This time around we need to implement a feature which allows us to filter the displayed list of companies based on the company's location. The requirement is that a user somehow should be allowed to select multiple locations to be filtered. How would you deal with this?

*For this exercise, you can assume that the array of companies contains only the initial number of elements*

## Exercise 5

Framework time! How would you implement exercise 4 with React and by using Redux for state handling?

*For this exercise, you may use create-react-app unless you prefer doing all the heavy lifting yourself*

## Bonus exercise

How would you implement a function that iterates over the array of companies and prints the index of each element after a 2 second delay?

*For this exercise, you can assume that the array of companies contains only the initial number of elements*
